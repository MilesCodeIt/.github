The duet is composed of...

- [**Vexcited**](https://github.com/Vexcited), a web developper that loves the MERN tech stack. He also uses TypeScript sometimes and Next.js for a lot of projects.
- [**Invertime**](https://github.com/Invertime), a game developper using Unity and C#. He is also very interested in cyber-security.

We both use tools like [Figma](https://figma.com) for designing and prototyping.
